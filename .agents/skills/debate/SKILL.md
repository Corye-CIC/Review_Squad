description: Run the Review Squad false-positive debate workflow on a code sample and answer key.
---

Use this skill when the user wants to stress-test review quality against a known answer key.

Expected input shape:
- `CODE:` block
- `ANSWER KEY:` block

Workflow:
1. Parse the code and answer key.
2. Never expose the answer key to the initial debating agents.
3. Run Round 1 openings in parallel with `fc_reviewer`, `jared_reviewer`, `stevey_reviewer`, and `pm_cory_reviewer`.
4. In Round 1, require every debating agent to obey the mandatory pre-flights before raising a finding:
   - transaction/idempotency
   - loop or N+1 complexity
   - parameterization or injection
   - return-contract accuracy when relevant
   - validation/normalization/deduplication
5. Send Round 1 outputs to `nando_debate_judge` for an interim verdict.
6. Run Round 2 rebuttals where each agent names the finding they most disagree with and explains why it is incorrect or overstated.
7. Run Round 3 with one falsifiable claim from each debating agent.
8. Send the full transcript to `nando_debate_judge` for the final verdict.
9. Only then send the answer key and full transcript to `emily_debate_validator`.
10. Return the final verdict, false positives, misses, and calibration notes.

Rules:
- Treat the answer key as private validation data.
- The value of this workflow is calibration, not theatrics.
- Focus on grounded false-positive analysis.
- If both `CODE:` and `ANSWER KEY:` are not present, stop and ask for them.
