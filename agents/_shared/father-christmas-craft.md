## Craft Intelligence

### Drive 1: Quality Absolutist

#### Code Smell Taxonomy

**Feature Envy**
- Signature: A method in class A accesses class B's data more than its own. `order.user.address.city` repeated throughout an `OrderService` method that should live closer to `User` or `Address`.
- Fix: Move the method to the class whose data it uses most. Or introduce a delegating method on the owning class.

**Shotgun Surgery**
- Signature: Adding one conceptual change (new `status` value, new payment type) requires edits in 5+ files with no shared type or constant.
- Fix: Single source of truth — define the enum/union/constant once, derive everywhere. `const OrderStatus = { PENDING: 'pending', SHIPPED: 'shipped' } as const` in one canonical location.

**Data Clumps**
- Signature: The same group of 3+ variables always travels together as separate parameters — `(firstName, lastName, email)` through four layers of functions.
- Fix: Introduce a value object. `ContactInfo { firstName, lastName, email }`. If data travels together, it belongs together.

**Primitive Obsession**
- Signature: Domain concepts as raw primitives — `userId: string`, `orderId: number` — with no type safety preventing cross-assignment. `createOrder(userId, orderId)` is callable as `createOrder(orderId, userId)` with no compiler error.
- Fix: Branded types — `type UserId = string & { readonly __brand: 'UserId' }`. Invalid cross-domain assignments become compile-time errors.

**Long Method**
- Signature: Method exceeds 40 lines. More telling: if you need a comment to label a section inside the method (`// Step 1: validate`, `// Step 2: build query`), those sections should be extracted methods.
- Fix: Extract until each function's name fully describes everything it does with no remainder. The extracted name IS the documentation.

**God Object**
- Signature: A class with 20+ methods spanning 3+ unrelated domains. `UserService` handling auth, profile updates, billing, notifications, and preferences.
- Fix: Decompose by domain responsibility. One class, one reason to change.

**Refused Bequest**
- Signature: Subclass inherits methods it doesn't need and overrides them to `throw new Error('not supported')` or a no-op.
- Fix: Favor composition over inheritance. The subclass wants one piece of the parent's behavior — extract that piece as a separate abstraction.

**Divergent Change**
- Signature: One class changes for multiple unrelated reasons — `ReportService` changes when the output format changes AND when data sources change AND when scheduling changes.
- Fix: SRP violation. Split by reason-to-change.

#### Naming Precision

**Functions:** Verb phrases that describe what they do completely. `getUser` not `user`. `calculateTotalPrice` not `totalPrice`. If the function name contains `And`, it does two things.

**Booleans:** Always `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`, `was` prefix. `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canDelete`, `shouldRetry`. Never naked adjectives or nouns: `active`, `permission`, `retry`.

**Collections:** Plural nouns. `users`, `orders`, `lineItems`. Never `userList`, `userArray`, `listOfUsers` — the type already tells you it's a list.

**Functions that return booleans:** Predicate naming. `isEligible()`, `hasAccess()`. Not `checkEligibility()`, `validateAccess()` — "check" and "validate" imply side effects.

**Event handlers:** `on` prefix for synchronous handlers, `handle` for async. `onUserCreated`, `handleOrderCompleted`.

**Constants:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level. CamelCase for local. Never magic numbers inline.

**Generic type parameters:** `T` for a single type; `TEntity`, `TResult`, `TKey` when multiple. `T`, `U`, `V` in sequence is cryptic.

**Banned as standalone names:** `data`, `info`, `manager`, `processor`, `handler`, `helper`, `utils`. These are meaning-free. Name the domain: `OrderProcessor` not `Processor`, `UserRepository` not `Repository`.

**File naming:** Consistent per project convention. Flag inconsistency — don't introduce `PascalCase.ts` into a `kebab-case.ts` repo.

---

#### Structure Standards

**Function length:** 20 lines soft limit, 40 hard. Every line beyond 20 should be questioned. Every line beyond 40 is a defect.

**File length:** 300 lines soft limit, 500 hard. Beyond 500 is almost always poor decomposition.

**Cyclomatic complexity:** ≤10 per function is clean. 11–14 is a warning. ≥15 is a REJECT. Every `if`, `else if`, `for`, `while`, `do`, `case`, `&&`, `||`, `??` adds 1.

**Nesting depth:** ≤3 levels. At 4+, use early returns, extract inner blocks, or restructure conditionals.

**Parameter count:** ≤3 for functions. At 4+, introduce a param object. Named parameters prevent argument-order bugs that compilers can't catch.

**Separation of concerns:** No function that fetches AND transforms AND writes. Read, transform, write are three responsibilities. A function that does all three has three reasons to change.

---

#### Error Handling Philosophy

**Never swallow silently.** `catch(e) {}` is always wrong. `catch(e) { logger.error(e) }` without rethrowing or returning an error value is a silent failure for the caller.

**Typed errors over string messages.** `throw new Error('something went wrong')` is uncatchable by type. `throw new ValidationError('email', 'must be valid format')` can be caught specifically and handled appropriately.

**Only catch when you can handle.** If you can't retry, transform meaningfully, or provide a fallback — rethrow. Catching to add context and rethrow is acceptable. Catching to swallow is never acceptable.

**Don't use exceptions for control flow.** `try { return JSON.parse(x) } catch { return null }` is flow control disguised as exception handling. Use a `safeJsonParse` helper that returns `T | null` explicitly.

**`finally` for cleanup only.** Never return a value from `finally`. Never use `finally` for branching logic.

---

#### Quality Enforcement Tiers

**REJECT — block the PR:**
- Swallowed exception (`catch` with no rethrow, no meaningful handling)
- N+1 query pattern in a production code path
- Missing transaction wrapping multi-table mutations
- Cyclomatic complexity ≥15 in a single function
- Missing FK constraint on a new relationship (same-schema, same-database, non-polymorphic; audit/event log tables exempt)
- `SELECT *` in a production query
- Primitive Obsession on cross-domain identifiers in a strictly-typed codebase

**WARN — must address before next release:**
- Function length > 40 lines
- File length > 500 lines
- Parameter count > 3 without a param object
- Naming violations (boolean without `is/has` prefix, function without verb phrase)
- Missing index on new `WHERE` / `JOIN ON` / `ORDER BY` columns
- SOLID violations that increase coupling or reduce testability
- Missing `created_at` / `updated_at` on new tables

**NOTE — informational, fix in follow-up:**
- Function 20–40 lines (soft limit breach)
- File 300–500 lines (soft limit breach)
- Minor naming improvements that don't significantly affect clarity
- Design pattern suggestions for future consideration
- Comments that better naming would replace
- Elegance opportunities that don't affect correctness or maintainability

### Drive 2: Creative Craftsman

#### SOLID Deep Cuts

**Single Responsibility Principle**
The real test is not "does this class do one thing?" but "for what single reason would this class change?" A class can do many things for one stakeholder. A class that changes for two different teams' requirements has two reasons to change — split it.
- Classic violation: `UserService` containing auth logic (security team owns) AND profile logic (product team owns). Different change cadences, different owners.
- Non-violation: `OrderCalculator.calculateTotal()` calling `applyDiscounts()` and `addTax()` — all three serve the same purpose.

**Open/Closed Principle**
Switch/if-else dispatching on type = OCP violation — adding a new type requires modifying existing code.
- Violation: `switch(payment.type) { case 'card': ...; case 'paypal': ...; }`
- Fix: Polymorphism — `payment.process()` where each payment type implements `process()`. Or discriminated union + exhaustiveness checking where polymorphism is overkill.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**
A subtype must be fully substitutable for its base type — callers must not break when using the subtype. If the subtype narrows preconditions, widens postconditions, or throws where the base doesn't, LSP is violated.
- Classic violation: `Square extends Rectangle`. Setting width on a Square changes height (to maintain squareness). Callers expecting independent width/height get broken behaviour.
- Fix: Don't inherit from a type if the child can't honour the parent's full contract. Prefer composition.

**Interface Segregation Principle**
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use. A large interface forces clients to implement no-ops or throw for methods they'll never call.
- Violation: `IRepository` with `save`, `delete`, `find`, `paginate`, `search`, `aggregate` — a read-only client must implement `save` and `delete` as stubs.
- Fix: `IReadRepository { find, paginate, search }` + `IWriteRepository { save, delete }`. Clients depend only on what they use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules — both should depend on abstractions.
- Violation: `UserService` that instantiates `new PostgresUserRepository()` internally. Testing requires a real database; swapping persistence requires changing UserService.
- Fix: Inject `IUserRepository`. `constructor(private readonly repo: IUserRepository)`. The DI container wires the concrete implementation.

#### Design Pattern Intelligence

**Repository Pattern**
- Use when: you want to swap data sources, test without a DB, or centralise query logic in one place.
- Don't use when: you have one data source, no tests that need isolation, and no reason to abstract. A Repository on a solo CRUD service is indirection for no gain.

**Factory Pattern**
- Use when: object creation has decision logic, multiple creation paths, or the caller shouldn't know the concrete type.
- Don't use when: the constructor takes two plain parameters. `createUser(name, email)` wrapping `new User(name, email)` is ceremony with no purpose.

**Strategy Pattern**
- Use when: you need to eliminate a `switch`/`if-else` dispatching on type, or the algorithm must be swappable at runtime.
- Don't use when: you have exactly one strategy with no plan for more. One strategy is just a function.

**Observer / Event Emitter**
- Use when: multiple independent systems react to an event without the emitter knowing about them. User created → email, analytics, storage provisioning — all decoupled.
- Don't use when: the event chain is primary data flow. Events make debugging archaeology. For primary flows, use direct calls with clear return values.

**Decorator**
- Use when: adding cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching, auth, metrics) without modifying core logic. The decorated thing must not need to know it's being decorated.
- Don't use when: the core logic needs the decorator's data. If the handler needs the cache key to make decisions, you don't have a decorator — you have a different class.

---

#### Elegance Heuristics

- **The naming test:** If the function's name accurately describes everything it does with no remainder, it's right-sized. If you'd need a footnote to be accurate, extract the footnote.
- **The comment test:** A comment that explains WHAT the code does is a naming failure. A comment that explains WHY is context that belongs. Convert all WHAT comments to better names.
- **The indirection test:** Indirection is only justified when it removes duplication, adds genuine flexibility, or makes the code significantly clearer. Indirection that requires a justification conversation is over-engineering.
- **The cleverness test:** Code that is clever in a way that requires explanation to the next developer is not clever — it's a liability. The best code is obviously correct, not impressively terse.
- **The extraction test:** If you can give a block of code a name that is shorter than the code itself and more informative — extract it. The extracted name IS the documentation.

---

### Drive 3: Database Authority

#### Query Patterns

**N+1**
- Signature: A list is fetched, then one query fires per item — `orders.map(o => db.findUser(o.userId))` in a loop. N orders = N+1 queries.
- Fix: JOIN the related data in the original query, or batch with `WHERE user_id IN ($1, $2, ..., $N)`. With ORMs: eager load — `.include('user')`, `.with('user')`, or ORM-specific eager loading API.
- Not N+1: A chunked batch loop `for (let i = 0; i < ids.length; i += CHUNK_SIZE)` — that's O(n/CHUNK) batched calls. Do not flag as N+1.

**SELECT ***
- Never in production queries. Fetches unused columns (wasted I/O), breaks when schema adds sensitive columns, prevents index-only scans.
- Always explicit: `SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE ...`

**OFFSET Pagination at Scale**
- `OFFSET 10000 LIMIT 20` forces the database to scan and discard 10,000 rows to return 20. Degrades linearly with page depth.
- Fix: Keyset / cursor pagination — `WHERE id > :last_seen_id ORDER BY id LIMIT 20`. O(1) regardless of page depth.

**Implicit Cartesian Product**
- Signature: `FROM orders, users WHERE ...` with a missing or wrong JOIN condition produces every combination of rows.
- Fix: Explicit JOIN syntax always: `FROM orders JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id`.

---

#### Index Intelligence

**Coverage rule:** Every `WHERE`, `JOIN ON`, and `ORDER BY` column on a high-volume table needs index analysis. Absence is not always wrong (low-selectivity columns, small tables), but the absence must be a conscious decision — not an oversight.

**Composite index column ordering:** For point lookups, highest-selectivity column first. For range scans on compound filters, put the equality-match column first, then the range column.

**Partial indexes for soft-delete:** `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` on every query with no partial index = full table scan at scale. Fix: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_active ON orders(id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.

**Always CONCURRENTLY in production:** `CREATE INDEX` acquires an exclusive lock — blocks all writes. `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` does not. Always use CONCURRENTLY on live tables.

**UUID vs sequential ID:** UUID primary keys cause B-tree fragmentation — random inserts scatter leaf pages, causing page splits and bloat. For high-insert tables, prefer `BIGSERIAL` / `IDENTITY` for PKs; use UUID as a secondary column for external-facing identifiers.

---

#### Schema Design

**NOT NULL by default.** Nullable means "a meaningful absence". If you find yourself writing `WHERE col IS NOT NULL` everywhere, the nullable was a mistake. Start strict; relax only with justification.

**Timestamp discipline.** Every table: `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL`, `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL`. Set defaults at the DB level — application code is unreliable for this. `updated_at` must be maintained via trigger or ORM hook.

**Polymorphic associations are almost always wrong.** `entity_type VARCHAR, entity_id INTEGER` has no real FK — no referential integrity, no orphan protection. Replace with separate join tables per entity type.

**DB enum vs VARCHAR + CHECK constraint.** DB-level `ENUM` types require `ALTER TYPE` to add values — expensive and lock-heavy on large tables. `VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL` with `CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'active', 'archived'))` is more migration-friendly. Document the tradeoff when using DB enums.

**FK constraints are not optional.** If a domain relationship exists, a FK must exist in the database. ORMs don't enforce this. Without FK constraints, orphan records accumulate silently.

---

#### Migration Safety

**NOT NULL on an existing large table — 3 steps, not 1:**
1. Add the column as nullable with a default: `ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN priority VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'normal'`
2. Backfill existing rows in batches (avoid long-running single transaction)
3. Add NOT NULL constraint: `ALTER TABLE orders ALTER COLUMN priority SET NOT NULL`
Never add a NOT NULL column in one step on a large table — it rewrites every row and blocks all writes for the duration.

**Column rename — 4 steps, not 1:**
1. Add the new column
2. Dual-write both old and new in application code
3. Backfill new column from old; migrate reads to new column
4. Drop old column after all application references are removed
Never rename a column in one step — deployed application code still references the old name during rollout.

**Idempotent migrations always.** Every migration must be safely re-runnable: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS`. CI must be able to run migrations from scratch and reach the same final state every time.

---

#### Integrity Patterns

**Transactions for multi-table mutations.** Any operation that writes to two or more tables must be wrapped in a transaction. Partial writes = data corruption. No exceptions.

**Optimistic locking for concurrent updates.** Two clients updating the same record without locking will silently overwrite each other. Pattern: `UPDATE records SET ..., version = version + 1 WHERE id = $1 AND version = $2 RETURNING *`. If nothing is returned, a concurrent update won — surface the conflict to the caller.

**CHECK constraints for domain invariants.** Invariants expressible as SQL should live in the database. `CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0)`, `CONSTRAINT valid_status CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'published', 'archived'))`. Don't rely on application code alone — the DB is the last line of defence.

**Idempotency pre-check before transactions.** Before flagging a missing transaction on a multi-table mutation, verify whether every mutation is idempotent. Upserts (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`), `SET` to fixed values, and timestamp fields like `updated_at = NOW()` are all idempotent — a re-run after partial failure reaches the correct final state without a transaction. Flag missing transactions only when at least one mutation is non-idempotent.

### Finding Reporting Standard

Every FC finding **must** include all three:

1. **Pattern/smell name** — the specific named issue (e.g., "N+1", "Feature Envy", "OCP Violation", "Primitive Obsession", "Shotgun Surgery", "OFFSET pagination")
2. **Exact citation** — `file:line` where the problem occurs. A finding without a line number is a phantom finding — do not raise it.
3. **Concrete fix** — the replacement code or schema change, not a prose description. If you can't write the fix, you haven't fully diagnosed the problem.
