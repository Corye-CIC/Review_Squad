<objective>
Read per-project `.review-squad/<project>/learnings.jsonl` files across the user's tree, cluster findings by type and keyword affinity to existing patterns, and either auto-update `squad-patterns/recurring-blockers.md` (known patterns gaining new citations) or surface NEW pattern candidates for user promotion.

Answers: "What failure modes are the squad catching repeatedly, and which ones have grown into generalizable patterns worth writing into the canonical pattern library?"

Self-improving squad mechanic: runs monthly. `recurring-blockers.md`, `tooling-patterns.md`, `verdict-trends.md`, `auto-fix-patterns.md` grow organically from telemetry. PM Cory and Nando read those files during `/plan`, `/consult`, `/review` — so promoting a pattern means every future review session now has it in context.
</objective>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS:
- `--period week|month|all` — window to include (default: all — this command is for rare, curated promotion, not weekly churn)
- `--min-projects N` — minimum distinct projects a cluster must appear in (default: 2)
- `--min-occurrences N` — minimum total occurrences across all projects (default: 3)
- `--dry-run` — report only. Do not write to `squad-patterns/`. Always set this first until you trust the classification.
- `--json` — structured JSON output instead of markdown

## Data sources

Per-project structured learnings (primary):
- `.review-squad/<project>/learnings.jsonl` — one JSON per line:
  ```
  {"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "source": "<agent>", "type": "quality|efficiency|security|...", "learning": "<text>", "files": ["..."], "severity": "low|medium|high"}
  ```

Canonical pattern files (promotion targets):
- `squad-patterns/recurring-blockers.md` — Tier A blocker classes (type safety, unimplemented features, null safety, ...)
- `squad-patterns/tooling-patterns.md` — dev environment / tooling friction
- `squad-patterns/verdict-trends.md` — reviewer verdict distribution signals
- `squad-patterns/auto-fix-patterns.md` — what `/review-auto` tends to succeed or fail at

Telemetry aggregate (supplementary, not primary):
- `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/memory/squad-metrics.jsonl` — counts only, not learning text
</context>

## Gotchas

- **Never overwrite an existing section.** When promoting a known pattern, ONLY update the `**Seen in:**` bullet list with new citations. Leave the pattern text, classification, and checks intact.
- **Never auto-append NEW patterns to recurring-blockers.md.** NEW patterns get a `## Candidates for promotion` block in the command output. User decides whether to write it in. This keeps the canonical file human-curated.
- **Classification is heuristic, not authoritative.** Keyword matching against existing pattern titles. If a learning could fit two patterns, report both candidates — don't guess.
- **Learnings files may be missing.** The command is best-effort across the filesystem. Missing files != zero learnings; surface any projects with >50 rounds in `review-history.md` but no `learnings.jsonl` as "uninstrumented".
- **Date filter on `date` field, not file mtime.** Learnings get appended with their own date; file mtime drifts if learnings are edited.

<process>

## Step 1: Discover learning sources

```bash
find "$HOME" -name "learnings.jsonl" -path "*/.review-squad/*" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Filter to files with at least 1 line. If zero files found, exit with:

```
No learnings found.

/squad-learnings reads .review-squad/<project>/learnings.jsonl files across your tree.
PM Cory writes to these during /plan, /implement, and /review sessions.

If you've never run /review with the full squad on a real project, there's nothing
to learn from yet. Run /review on a real codebase first, then try again.
```

## Step 2: Load and filter learnings

For each `learnings.jsonl`:
- Parse each line (skip malformed lines silently)
- Apply period filter on the `date` field
- Record: `{project, date, source, type, learning, files, severity}`

Extract `project` from the path: `.review-squad/<project>/learnings.jsonl` → `<project>`.

## Step 3: Cluster findings

### 3a. Load existing pattern titles

Read `squad-patterns/recurring-blockers.md` and extract top-level headings (lines starting with `## ` but not `## Promotion criteria`). Build a list of canonical patterns:

```
["Type Safety & Schema Mismatches",
 "Unimplemented / Promised-But-Missing Features",
 "Null-Safety & Error-Path Gaps",
 ...]
```

Build keyword synonyms per pattern (inline in command; not a separate config):
- Type Safety → `enum, schema, type, drizzle, typescript, varchar, nullable, mismatch, signature`
- Unimplemented → `not implemented, missing, promised, declared but, not wired, TODO, unimplemented`
- Null-Safety → `null, nullable, undefined, NULL, unchecked, guard, assertion, throws, silent`

### 3b. Score each learning against each pattern

For each learning:
- Lowercase the `learning` text
- For each canonical pattern, count keyword matches
- Assign the pattern with the highest score, IF score >= 2 matches
- Else mark as `uncategorized`

Emit per (pattern, project) tallies and per uncategorized learning clusters (see Step 4).

### 3c. Cluster uncategorized learnings

Group uncategorized learnings by `type` field first, then by the first 5 significant words of `learning` (nouns only, naive stopword filter). Emit only clusters that hit `--min-occurrences` AND `--min-projects`.

## Step 4: Build promotion report

### 4a. Known-pattern updates (auto-apply)

For each canonical pattern with new citations (project not already listed under **Seen in:**):
- Output a proposed line: `  - \`<project>\` (learnings YYYY-MM-DD through YYYY-MM-DD) — <truncated 120-char summary from top learning>`
- If not `--dry-run`: apply via Edit — insert the new bullet into the existing **Seen in:** block of the matching `## <pattern>` section. Never touch other sections.

### 4b. NEW pattern candidates (manual review)

For each uncategorized cluster passing the thresholds, output:

```markdown
### Candidate: <auto-derived title from top keywords>

Threshold: appeared in <N> projects, <M> total occurrences, <max severity>

**Citations:**
- `<project1>` (YYYY-MM-DD) — "<learning text>"
- `<project2>` (YYYY-MM-DD) — "<learning text>"
- ...

**Suggested classification:** <BLOCKER | REVISE> (based on max severity in cluster)

**Promotion action (user runs manually):**
1. Choose a canonical pattern name
2. Decide the plan-time / implement-time / review-time preempt checks
3. Edit `squad-patterns/recurring-blockers.md` and add the section
```

This output is the command's primary value for genuinely new patterns — the user curates the final text; the command surfaces what's ready to be curated.

## Step 5: Render output

If `--json`:

```json
{
  "period": "<period>",
  "projects_scanned": 7,
  "learnings_total": 428,
  "known_pattern_updates": [
    {
      "pattern": "Type Safety & Schema Mismatches",
      "new_projects": ["new-project-a"],
      "applied": true
    }
  ],
  "candidates": [
    {
      "title": "Missing retry/timeout on external API calls",
      "projects": ["proj-a", "proj-b"],
      "occurrences": 7,
      "max_severity": "high",
      "sample_learnings": [...]
    }
  ],
  "uninstrumented_projects": ["proj-c"]
}
```

If markdown (default):

```markdown
# Squad Learnings — <period>

## Scan summary
- Projects scanned: 7
- Total learnings: 428
- Period: <start date> to <end date>

## Known pattern updates <applied | dry-run>
- **Type Safety & Schema Mismatches** — added citation for `new-project-a` (2026-04-03)
- **Null-Safety & Error-Path Gaps** — added citation for `new-project-b` (2026-04-12)

## Candidates for promotion (2)

### Candidate: Missing retry/timeout on external API calls
Threshold: 2 projects, 7 occurrences, max severity high

**Citations:**
- `proj-a` (2026-04-01) — "fetch call to /campaigns has no timeout, hangs indefinitely on network partition"
- `proj-b` (2026-04-08) — "stripe.charges.create lacks retry on 5xx; silently fails the order"

**Suggested classification:** BLOCKER

**Promotion action:** see recurring-blockers.md and add a new section following the existing schema.

### Candidate: ...

## Uninstrumented projects
- `proj-c` — has review history but no learnings.jsonl. PM Cory may not have been dispatched on this project. Re-run /review with --full squad to populate.
```

## Step 6: Apply updates (if not `--dry-run`)

For each known-pattern update:
- Locate the `## <pattern>` heading
- Locate the `**Seen in:**` block within that section
- Insert the new citation line at the end of the existing bullets
- Preserve all surrounding formatting exactly

NEVER:
- Modify pattern text
- Remove existing citations
- Reorder sections
- Append NEW patterns to the file (always surface as candidate)

After writing, stage nothing. Commit is the user's decision.

## Step 7: Update self

Append a log line to the canonical log path (resolved similarly to Step 1: prefer `./squad-patterns/` if cwd is Review_Squad, else `~/.claude/squad-patterns/`). Target file: `<canonical-squad-patterns-dir>/.learnings-log.jsonl` (create if missing):

```json
{"ts":"<ISO>","projects_scanned":N,"learnings_total":M,"updates_applied":K,"candidates":J}
```

This allows `/squad-report` to show "last learnings run" without re-scanning.

Step 4a edits also target files in the resolved `squad-patterns/` dir — NEVER write into a project's local `.review-squad/` as a canonical target.
