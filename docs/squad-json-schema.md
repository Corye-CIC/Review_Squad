# Squad Verdict JSON Schema

Canonical machine-parseable output emitted by `/review --ci` and consumed by `scripts/squad-pr-review.sh`, `/squad-report`, and the Phase 4 dashboard.

The schema is versioned. Breaking changes bump `schema_version`; additive changes do not. CI wrappers MUST reject unknown `schema_version` values rather than guess at forward compatibility.

---

## Emission contract

When `/review` runs with `--ci`, it suppresses the user-facing markdown narrative and emits exactly one JSON block wrapped in sentinel tags at the end of stdout:

```
<squad-verdict-json>
{ ... }
</squad-verdict-json>
```

The wrapper script greps for the sentinel block and extracts the JSON. Anything before the block is log output (safe to discard). Anything after the block is forbidden — the block must be the last payload.

If `/review` cannot produce a verdict (classifier skip-mode, pre-flight failure, budget exceeded), it still emits a JSON block with `verdict: "SKIPPED"` or `verdict: "ABORTED"` and a `reason` field. The wrapper never needs to parse human-readable text.

## Field reference

### Top-level

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | string | yes | Always `"1"` in this release |
| `verdict` | enum | yes | Final combined verdict |
| `summary` | string | yes | Short synthesis; for PR comment header |
| `routing_mode` | enum | yes | Which mode the Step 0.5 classifier picked |
| `routing_override` | string \| null | yes | Populated when `--mode` overrode the classifier, else null |
| `nando` | object | when verdict ≠ SKIPPED | Nando's technical verdict |
| `emily` | object | when verdict ∉ {SKIPPED, ABORTED} | Emily runs in thin, full, and deep modes — she always follows Nando. Only a full classifier skip or pre-flight abort omits her |
| `findings` | object | yes | Always present; arrays may be empty |
| `overturned_findings` | array | yes | Empty when Nando overturned nothing |
| `chunking` | object | yes | `chunked: false` when diff ≤ 30 files |
| `files_reviewed` | array | yes | Paths relative to repo root |
| `metadata` | object | yes | Audit + cost tracking |
| `reason` | string \| null | yes | Populated on SKIPPED or ABORTED, else null |

### `verdict` enumeration

| Value | When | CI exit code |
|---|---|---|
| `APPROVE` | Nando APPROVE + Emily CONFIRM (or Emily not required) | 0 |
| `CONDITIONAL_APPROVE` | Nando CONDITIONAL APPROVE with open blocked findings | 0 |
| `REVISE` | Nando REVISE OR Emily CHALLENGE | 1 |
| `BLOCK` | Nando BLOCK | 1 |
| `SKIPPED` | Classifier skip-mode, or no files to review | 0 |
| `ABORTED` | Pre-flight failed, budget exceeded, or auth failure | 2 |

### `findings.<tier>[]`

Each finding entry:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Stable within a review run: `B1`, `M1`, `R1`, `N1`, `BS1` |
| `title` | string | yes | ≤ 80 chars |
| `detail` | string | yes | Full reasoning; may include code excerpts |
| `file` | string \| null | yes | null when the finding is cross-cutting |
| `line` | integer \| null | yes | null when finding is not line-specific |
| `raised_by` | enum | yes | Agent name lowercased |
| `class` | string \| null | yes | Same tag vocabulary as `overturned_findings.class`. Null when the orchestrator could not extract a recognizable class tag from the reviewer's output. Consumers MUST handle null — never assume the tag is set |
| `severity` | enum | yes | Matches tier name (blocker / must-fix / recommended / nit / boyscout) |

### `overturned_findings[]`

Emitted only when the routing mode includes Nando synthesis (thin / full / deep). Extracted from Nando's `## Overturned Findings (telemetry)` section per the tag format in `agents/nando-review.md`. Empty when Nando overturned nothing.

### `chunking`

```json
{
  "chunked": true,
  "strategy": "monorepo | path-segment",
  "chunks": [
    {
      "label": "workspace-api",
      "file_count": 18,
      "routing_mode": "full-mode",
      "verdict": "APPROVE"
    }
  ]
}
```

`chunked: false` implies `chunks: []` and `strategy: null`.

### `metadata.cost_estimate_usd`

Rough estimate from per-mode token projections × current model rates. Not authoritative — real billing shows in the Anthropic console. Accuracy target: within ±30%. The wrapper uses this to detect budget overruns before the review starts, not after.

### `metadata.parse_warnings`

Array of strings. Empty when finding parsing produced no issues. Populated when Nando's review output lacked the expected structure (free-form prose instead of bulleted items under a tier section, or a section heading was absent). Consumers should treat a non-empty `parse_warnings` array as a signal that the `findings` data may be incomplete — the verdict field is still authoritative.

---

## SKIPPED / ABORTED envelope

When the review cannot complete, most fields are still emitted with null / empty values; only `verdict`, `reason`, and `metadata` carry information:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "verdict": "SKIPPED",
  "summary": "Diff classified as docs-only (2 files, 47 lines). Skipping squad.",
  "routing_mode": "skip-mode",
  "routing_override": null,
  "nando": null,
  "emily": null,
  "findings": { "blockers": [], "must_fix": [], "recommended": [], "nits": [], "boyscout": [] },
  "overturned_findings": [],
  "chunking": { "chunked": false, "chunks": [], "strategy": null },
  "files_reviewed": ["README.md", "docs/CONTRIBUTING.md"],
  "metadata": { ... },
  "reason": "classifier-skip-mode"
}
```

**`files_reviewed` contract in SKIPPED/ABORTED:** Populated when the classifier resolved a file list (e.g., skip-mode after file discovery). Empty array otherwise (e.g., `preflight-typecheck-failed` where resolution never happened). `metadata.file_count` always mirrors `files_reviewed.length`. Consumers can iterate the array without null checks — the field is always an array.

**Additive metadata keys** (`parse_warnings`, `push_error`) are always emitted as `[]` or `null` respectively — never absent. Consumers can rely on their presence across all verdict values including SKIPPED and ABORTED.

`reason` vocabulary (fixed string enum):

| Reason | Context |
|---|---|
| `classifier-skip-mode` | Step 0.5 returned skip-mode |
| `no-files-changed` | Step 1 found no files to review |
| `preflight-typecheck-failed` | Step 0c typecheck returned non-zero |
| `preflight-lint-failed` | Step 0c lint returned non-zero |
| `preflight-branch-mismatch` | Step 0b PR branch mismatch |
| `budget-exceeded` | Cost estimate > `.github/squad-budget.yml` threshold |
| `auth-missing` | No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OAuth token in environment |
| `classifier-error` | Unexpected classifier failure |

---

## Consumer contract

Wrappers and tools consuming this schema MUST:

1. Reject unknown `schema_version`. Do not attempt forward-compat guesses.
2. Treat absent optional fields as null, not errors.
3. Preserve `id` strings when re-emitting findings (e.g., in PR comments). IDs are stable handles for humans replying to specific findings.
4. Never mutate the JSON emitted by `/review --ci`. Parse → transform → emit a new object for downstream stages.

Wrappers MAY:

- Filter findings by severity before posting a PR comment (e.g., drop `nits` in comment but keep in full artifact)
- Re-map `class` tags to human-friendly labels for display
- Augment metadata with CI-system fields (workflow run URL, actor, etc.) in a sibling `ci_metadata` object — never under `metadata`

---

## /review-auto augmented fields

`/review-auto --ci` emits the same schema plus five auto-fix-specific keys:

```json
{
  "auto_fix_applied": true,
  "auto_fix_rounds": 2,
  "auto_fix_items_applied": 7,
  "auto_fix_items_skipped": 3,
  "auto_fix_commits": ["abc1234", "def5678"],
  "auto_fix_status": "success | cap-reached | aborted-unsafe | push-failed"
}
```

Consumers inspecting a verdict from `/review-auto` MUST check `auto_fix_applied` before interpreting other fields. When `false`, the squad made no changes and `findings` reflects the original (un-fixed) state. When `true`, `findings` reflects the post-fix re-review.

The standard `metadata` object also gains `push_error: string | null` — populated when `auto_fix_status == "push-failed"`, null otherwise.

The same `schema_version: "1"` covers both `/review --ci` and `/review-auto --ci` outputs. Consumers distinguish by the presence of the `auto_fix_*` keys.

## Schema evolution

Additive changes that do not break existing consumers do not bump `schema_version`:
- New optional fields on existing objects
- New values in open enums (`class`, `reason` when documented)
- New tiers in `findings`

Breaking changes bump to v2:
- Renaming fields
- Removing fields
- Changing field types
- Tightening enum values that were previously open

Consumers pin to `schema_version: "1"` until they explicitly add v2 support.
