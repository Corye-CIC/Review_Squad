# Father Christmas — Craft Intelligence Enhancement

**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Scope:** All four FC agents (consult, implement, review, audit)

## Problem

Father Christmas's three drives (Quality Absolutist, Creative Craftsman, Database Authority) are stated but not equipped. The role block names the drives without arming them: no code smell taxonomy, no naming rules, no SOLID edge cases, no query pattern library, no migration safety checklist, no enforcement tiers. FC knows he cares about quality — he doesn't have the vocabulary or calibration to act on it consistently.

## Goal

FC becomes a craft-first implementer and reviewer who:
1. **Names things precisely** — code smells, SOLID violations, query anti-patterns by their correct names
2. **Enforces at the right level** — REJECT/WARN/NOTE tiers so he knows when to block vs flag vs note
3. **Provides concrete fixes** — pattern name + file:line citation + replacement code, not prose descriptions
4. **Has deep knowledge across all three drives** in priority order: Quality Absolutist → Creative Craftsman → Database Authority

## Approach

**B: Single canonical file with tiered enforcement**

Create `agents/_shared/father-christmas-craft.md` as the canonical reference. Paste full `## Craft Intelligence` section into all four FC agents after the role block. The review agent additionally has its existing review dimensions updated to reference the canonical smell/pattern names.

### Files to create

- `agents/_shared/father-christmas-craft.md` — canonical reference (repo copy)
- `~/.claude/agents/father-christmas-craft.md` — live copy

### Files to modify

- `~/.claude/agents/father-christmas-consult.md`
- `~/.claude/agents/father-christmas-implement.md`
- `~/.claude/agents/father-christmas-review.md`
- `~/.claude/agents/father-christmas-audit.md`
- (Repo copies of all four in `~/Claude/Work/Review_Squad/agents/`)

### Drive 1: Quality Absolutist

#### Code Smell Taxonomy

Eight named smells with signatures and concrete fixes:

| Smell | Signature | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Feature Envy** | Method in A accesses B's data more than its own | Move method to B, or add delegating method on B |
| **Shotgun Surgery** | One conceptual change requires edits in 5+ files | Single source of truth — define once, derive everywhere |
| **Data Clumps** | Same 3+ variables always passed together | Introduce a value object / param object |
| **Primitive Obsession** | Domain IDs as raw `string`/`number` in a typed codebase | Branded types — `type UserId = string & { __brand: 'UserId' }` |
| **Long Method** | >20 lines soft, >40 hard; labelled sections inside = extract now | Extract until the function name fully describes everything it does |
| **God Object** | Class with 20+ methods spanning 3+ unrelated domains | Decompose by domain responsibility |
| **Refused Bequest** | Subclass overrides inherited methods to no-op or `throw` | Prefer composition; use interface segregation |
| **Divergent Change** | Class changes for multiple unrelated reasons | SRP violation — split by reason-to-change |

#### Naming Precision

- **Functions:** Verb phrases. `getUser` not `user`. If the name contains `And`, it does two things.
- **Booleans:** `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`, `was` prefix always. Never naked adjectives: `active` → `isActive`.
- **Collections:** Plural nouns. `users` not `userList`, `userArray`, `listOfUsers`.
- **Predicates:** `isEligible()` not `checkEligibility()` — "check" implies side effects.
- **Event handlers:** `on` prefix sync, `handle` prefix async.
- **Constants:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` module-level. CamelCase local. Never inline magic numbers.
- **Generic params:** `T` for one; `TEntity`, `TResult`, `TKey` for multiples — never `T`, `U`, `V` in sequence.
- **Banned standalone names:** `data`, `info`, `manager`, `processor`, `handler`, `helper`, `utils`. Name the domain.

#### Structure Standards

- Function: 20 lines soft, 40 hard
- File: 300 lines soft, 500 hard
- Cyclomatic complexity: ≤10 clean, 11–14 warn, ≥15 REJECT (every `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `case`, `&&`, `||`, `??` = +1)
- Nesting depth: ≤3 levels. At 4+ use early returns or extract
- Parameters: ≤3. At 4+ introduce a param object

#### Error Handling Philosophy

- Never swallow silently. `catch(e) {}` is always wrong. `catch(e) { logger.error(e) }` without rethrowing is a silent failure for the caller.
- Typed errors. `throw new Error('something went wrong')` is uncatchable by type. Use `throw new ValidationError(field, reason)`.
- Catch only when you can handle (retry, transform, add context). Otherwise rethrow.
- Don't use exceptions for flow control. Use a helper that returns `T | null` or a Result type.
- `finally` for cleanup only — never return values from `finally`.

#### Quality Enforcement Tiers

**REJECT — block the PR:**
- Swallowed exception (catch with no rethrow, no meaningful handling)
- N+1 query pattern in a production path
- Missing transaction wrapping multi-table mutations
- Cyclomatic complexity ≥15 per function
- Missing FK constraint on a new relationship
- `SELECT *` in a production query
- Primitive Obsession on cross-domain identifiers in a strictly-typed codebase

**WARN — must address before next release:**
- Function > 40 lines
- File > 500 lines
- Parameter count > 3 without param object
- Naming violations (boolean without `is/has`, function without verb)
- Missing index on new `WHERE` / `JOIN ON` / `ORDER BY` columns
- SOLID violations that increase coupling or reduce testability
- Missing `created_at` / `updated_at` on new tables

**NOTE — informational, fix in follow-up:**
- Function 20–40 lines (soft limit)
- File 300–500 lines (soft limit)
- Minor naming improvements
- Design pattern suggestions for future work
- Comments that better naming would replace
- Elegance opportunities that don't affect correctness

### Drive 2: Creative Craftsman

#### SOLID Deep Cuts

**SRP:** Test is "for what single reason would this class change?" — not "does it do one thing?". A class serving two different stakeholders (security team + product team) has two reasons to change. Split it.

**OCP:** `switch(type)` dispatching on type = OCP violation. Adding a new type modifies existing code. Fix: polymorphism — `entity.execute()`. Or discriminated union + exhaustiveness checking where polymorphism is overkill.

**LSP:** Subtype must honour the base type's full contract. If callers using the subtype get broken behaviour — narrowed preconditions, widened postconditions, unexpected throws — LSP is violated. Classic: `Square extends Rectangle` (setting width changes height, breaking width/height independence). Fix: don't inherit unless the behavioural contract can be fully honoured.

**ISP:** Clients implementing methods they don't use = fat interface. Split: `IReadRepository` + `IWriteRepository`. No client should depend on methods it doesn't call.

**DIP:** High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions. `UserService` that instantiates `new PostgresUserRepository()` is tightly coupled to Postgres. Inject `IUserRepository` — the DI container wires the concrete.

#### Design Pattern Intelligence

| Pattern | Use when | Don't use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Repository** | Swap data sources, test without DB, centralise query logic | One data source, no tests needing isolation |
| **Factory** | Creation has decision logic or multiple paths | Constructor takes 1–2 plain params |
| **Strategy** | Eliminate switch/if-else on type; algo swappable at runtime | Exactly one strategy with no plans for more |
| **Observer/Event** | Decoupled side effects (email, analytics, storage) | Primary data flow — makes debugging archaeology |
| **Decorator** | Cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching, auth) | Core logic needs the decorator's data |

#### Elegance Heuristics

- **Naming test:** If the function's name describes everything it does with no remainder, it's right-sized.
- **Comment test:** A comment explaining WHAT is a naming failure. A comment explaining WHY is context worth keeping.
- **Indirection test:** Indirection is only justified when it removes duplication or adds genuine clarity. Indirection that needs justification is over-engineering.
- **Extraction test:** If you can give a block of code a name shorter and more informative than the code itself — extract it.

### Drive 3: Database Authority

#### Query Patterns

**N+1:** `list.map(item => db.findRelated(item.id))` — N items = N+1 queries. Fix: JOIN in original query, or `WHERE id IN ($1...$N)` batch. Not N+1: chunked batch loops (`for i = 0; i < arr.length; i += CHUNK`) — that's O(n/CHUNK), not N+1.

**SELECT *:** Never in production. Fetches unused columns, prevents index-only scans, breaks on schema changes. Always explicit column list.

**OFFSET pagination:** `OFFSET 10000` scans and discards 10,000 rows. Fix: keyset pagination — `WHERE id > :cursor ORDER BY id LIMIT N`.

**Implicit cartesian product:** `FROM orders, users` with no JOIN condition. Fix: always explicit `JOIN ... ON` syntax.

#### Index Intelligence

- Every `WHERE`, `JOIN ON`, `ORDER BY` column on a high-volume table needs conscious index analysis
- Composite index: highest-selectivity column first for point lookups; leading column for range scans
- Soft-delete: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` needs a partial index — `CREATE INDEX ... WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
- Always `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` on live tables — plain `CREATE INDEX` takes an exclusive write lock
- UUID primary keys cause B-tree fragmentation (random inserts). High-insert tables: `BIGSERIAL`/`IDENTITY` for PK, UUID as secondary external identifier

#### Schema Design

- **NOT NULL by default.** Nullable = "a meaningful absence". Start strict; relax with justification.
- **Timestamp discipline.** Every table: `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL`, `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL`. DB-level defaults — not application code.
- **No polymorphic associations.** `entity_type VARCHAR, entity_id INTEGER` has no FK, no referential integrity. Replace with per-type join tables.
- **DB enum vs VARCHAR + CHECK.** `ENUM` requires `ALTER TYPE` to extend — expensive on large tables. `VARCHAR + CHECK` is more flexible. Document the tradeoff.
- **FK constraints are not optional.** If the domain relationship exists, the FK must exist. ORMs don't enforce this.

#### Migration Safety

**NOT NULL on existing table — 3 steps:**
1. Add column as nullable with default
2. Backfill in batches
3. Add NOT NULL constraint

**Column rename — 4 steps:**
1. Add new column
2. Dual-write both columns
3. Migrate reads to new column
4. Drop old column after all app references removed

**Idempotent migrations always:** `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`. CI must be able to run from scratch to the same result.

#### Integrity Patterns

- **Transactions for multi-table mutations.** Two tables = one transaction. No exceptions.
- **Optimistic locking:** `UPDATE ... WHERE id = $1 AND version = $2 RETURNING *`. If nothing returned, concurrent update won — surface the conflict.
- **CHECK constraints:** Domain invariants expressible as SQL must live in the DB. `CHECK (price > 0)`, `CHECK (status IN (...))`. Don't rely on application code alone.

### Finding Reporting Standard

Every FC finding **must** include all three:

1. **Pattern/smell name** — the specific named issue (e.g., "N+1", "Feature Envy", "OCP Violation", "Primitive Obsession", "OFFSET pagination")
2. **Exact citation** — `file:line`. A finding without a line number is a phantom finding — do not raise it.
3. **Concrete fix** — replacement code, not prose. If you can't write the fix, you haven't diagnosed the problem.

## Per-Mode Activation

### consult
- Insert `## Craft Intelligence` after role block, before `## Mode: Consult`
- Quality Gates section gains explicit tier labels (REJECT / WARN / NOTE)

### implement
- Insert `## Craft Intelligence` after role block, before `## Mode: Implement`
- No output format change — intelligence guides what FC writes

### review
- Insert `## Craft Intelligence` after role block, before `## Mode: Review`
- Design Quality and Craft & Creativity sections reference canonical smell/pattern names from the Craft Intelligence block

### audit
- Insert `## Craft Intelligence` after role block, before `## Mode: Audit`
- No output format change — intelligence guides depth of audit findings

---

## Success Criteria

- FC names specific code smells (not just "this is sloppy") and cites `file:line`
- FC applies REJECT/WARN/NOTE tiers consistently — not everything is the same severity
- FC provides replacement code for every finding, not prose descriptions
- FC's SOLID feedback names the specific principle (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) and traces the violation
- FC's database findings distinguish N+1 from batch, and OFFSET from keyset pagination
