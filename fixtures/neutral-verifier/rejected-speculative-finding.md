# Neutral Verifier Fixture - Rejected Speculative Finding

Reviewer: FC
Finding class: migration/schema/data loss

Claim:
This migration might drop production data because it changes a nullable text column to `varchar(255)`.

Cited evidence:

```sql
ALTER TABLE comments
  ALTER COLUMN body TYPE varchar(255);
```

Expected verifier decision:

```text
Decision: REJECTED
Evidence: The cited SQL shows a type narrowing, but no existing data distribution, truncation behavior, database engine rule, or failing invariant is provided.
Reasoning: The claim may be worth investigating, but the supplied evidence does not prove production data loss. It only restates a possible migration concern.
Required next action: Request data-length evidence or database-specific migration behavior before treating this as confirmed.
```
